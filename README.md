# Loops With Friends

[Loops With Friends] is a collaborative music-making web app built with [Elixir]/[Phoenix], [Elm], and the [WebAudio API].

It supports up to seven users in a given "jam," in which each user gets their own music loop. Each user can start and stop their loop to make music in real time with the other users in the jam. The app automatically creates and balances additional jams as users join and leave.

See these blog posts for more on how it's built.
